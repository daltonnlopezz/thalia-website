# Welcome to My Blog!

This is how you create a new blog post. Here's what you need to know:

## How to Create a New Post

1. **Create a new file** in the `public/blog-posts/` folder
2. **Name it** something like `my-post-title.md`
3. **Copy this template** and fill in your content
4. **Write your post** using Markdown (it's easy!)

## Markdown Basics

- Use `#` for headings
- Use `**bold**` for **bold text**
- Use `*italic*` for *italic text*
- Use `-` for bullet points
- Use `[link text](URL)` for links

## Example Content

Here's some sample content to show you how it works:

> This is a quote block. Perfect for highlighting important information!

### Lists are easy too:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

### And you can add images:

## That's It!

Once you save your file and push it to GitHub, it will automatically appear on the website. Pretty cool, right?
